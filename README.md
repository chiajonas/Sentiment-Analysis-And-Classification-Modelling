# Sentiment-Analysis-And-Classification-Modelling
This is a Sentiment Analysis And Classification Modelling project on E-Commerce Clothing Reviews
Background and Problem Statement
One of the challenges that businesses face is how to gain a better understanding of the voice of the customer. This issue can be addressed by extracting additional information from customer reviews, using sentiment analysis. Customer feedback provides a useful platform to discover a huge range of customer-initiated reactions to the product(s) that they have purchased. Text analytics provide businesses a more holistic picture of customers’ satisfaction or dissatisfaction. It is insufficient to rely on customers’ ratings alone to find out their experiences. This is because reviews can provide important feedback to businesses, that would not be captured using a Likert scale. For instance, a five-star review can contain important requests for improved delivery time or customer support. Uncovering deeper insights about customers’ reviews enable businesses to respond to reviews more strategically and effectively and consider modifying their current systems and approaches so that they can better serve their customers.

Project Description and Objectives
This project, we are going to use the dataset of women’s e-commerce clothing reviews to perform analytics. Our research can be split into three parts. First, we are looking into the relationship between classes / departments and recommendations to see what kind of classes/departments got relatively positive or negative reviews. Second, we are going to conduct sentiment analysis and produce word clouds to look into positive and negative words. Lastly, we are going to build different predictive models and see how the models perform.
